      <description>Table of Contents Project Overview The Data Neural Network Models Results Future Directions
Project Overview  Over a year in and the COVID-19 pandemic is still as present as ever - and with that, wearing masks in public places has become the new normal. Despite much resistance, mask wearing is critical to keep the general population safe and minimize the spread of the virus.
The goal of this project was to build a neural network model which could be used to determine whether or not people are wearing face masks.</description>
